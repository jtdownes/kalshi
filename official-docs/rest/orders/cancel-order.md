Cancel Order
Endpoint for canceling orders. The value for the orderId should match the id field of the order you want to decrease. Commonly, DELETE-type endpoints return 204 status with no body content on success. But we can’t completely delete the order, as it may be partially filled already. Instead, the DeleteOrder endpoint reduce the order completely, essentially zeroing the remaining resting contracts on it. The zeroed order is returned on the response payload as a form of validation for the client.

order.side
enum<string>requireddeprecated
Deprecated. Use outcome_side (or book_side) instead. See Order direction. This field will not be removed before May 14, 2026.

Available options: yes, no 
​
order.action
enum<string>requireddeprecated
Deprecated. Use outcome_side (or book_side) instead. See Order direction. This field will not be removed before May 14, 2026.

​
order.outcome_side
enum<string>required
The outcome side this order is positioned for. buy-yes and sell-no produce 'yes'; buy-no and sell-yes produce 'no'.

outcome_side describes directional exposure only; it does not change the order's price. An order at price p with outcome_side=no is matched by an order at the same price p with outcome_side=yes — both parties trade at the same price, just on opposite directions.

outcome_side and book_side will become the canonical way to determine order direction. The legacy action, side, and is_yes fields will be deprecated in a future release — please migrate to these new fields.

Available options: yes, no 
​
order.book_side
enum<string>required
Same directional bit as outcome_side in book vocabulary. 'bid' is equivalent to outcome_side 'yes'; 'ask' is equivalent to outcome_side 'no'.

outcome_side and book_side will become the canonical way to determine order direction. The legacy action, side, and is_yes fields will be deprecated in a future release — please migrate to these new fields.
