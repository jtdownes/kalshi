Overview
Kalshi’s WebSocket API provides real-time updates for:
Order book changes
Trade executions
Market status updates
Fill notifications
​
Connection URL
Connect to the WebSocket endpoint at:
wss://external-api-ws.kalshi.com/trade-api/ws/v2
For the demo environment, use:
wss://external-api-ws.demo.kalshi.co/trade-api/ws/v2
The existing shared WebSocket hosts, wss://api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/ws/v2 for production and wss://demo-api.kalshi.co/trade-api/ws/v2 for demo, remain supported. For the full endpoint list, see API Environments and Endpoints.
​
Authentication
WebSocket connections require authentication during the connection handshake.
Once connected, channels fall into two groups:
Private channels (user-specific data): orderbook_delta, fill, market_positions, communications, order_group_updates
Public market-data channels (no additional channel-level auth): ticker, trade, market_lifecycle_v2, multivariate_market_lifecycle, multivariate
In other words, even channels that carry public market data still use the authenticated WebSocket session, but they do not impose additional per-channel authorization checks.
For detailed information about API key generation and request signing, see our API Keys documentation.
​
Required Headers
When establishing the WebSocket connection, include these headers:
KALSHI-ACCESS-KEY: your_api_key_id
KALSHI-ACCESS-SIGNATURE: request_signature
KALSHI-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP: unix_timestamp_in_milliseconds
​
Signing the WebSocket Request
The signature for WebSocket connections follows the same pattern as REST API requests:
Create the message to sign:
timestamp + "GET" + "/trade-api/ws/v2"
Generate the signature using your private key (see API Keys documentation)
Include the headers when opening the WebSocket connection
​
Establishing a Connection
To connect to the WebSocket API, you need to:
Generate authentication headers (same as REST API)
Create a WebSocket connection with those headers
Handle the connection lifecycle
Here’s how to establish an authenticated connection:
import websockets
import asyncio

# WebSocket URL
ws_url = "wss://external-api-ws.demo.kalshi.co/trade-api/ws/v2"  # Demo environment

# Generate authentication headers (see API Keys documentation)
auth_headers = {
    "KALSHI-ACCESS-KEY": "your_api_key_id",
    "KALSHI-ACCESS-SIGNATURE": "generated_signature",
    "KALSHI-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP": "timestamp_in_milliseconds"
}

# Connect with authentication
async def connect():
    async with websockets.connect(ws_url, additional_headers=auth_headers) as websocket:
        print("Connected to Kalshi WebSocket")

        # Connection is now established
        # You can start sending and receiving messages

        # Listen for messages
        async for message in websocket:
            print(f"Received: {message}")

# Run the connection
asyncio.run(connect())
​
Subscribing to Data
Once connected, subscribe to channels by sending a subscription command:
import json

async def subscribe_to_ticker(websocket):
    """Subscribe to ticker updates"""
    subscription = {
        "id": 1,
        "cmd": "subscribe",
        "params": {
            "channels": ["ticker"]
        }
    }
    await websocket.send(json.dumps(subscription))

async def subscribe_to_orderbook(websocket, market_tickers):
    """Subscribe to orderbook updates for specific markets"""
    subscription = {
        "id": 2,
        "cmd": "subscribe",
        "params": {
            "channels": ["orderbook_delta"],
            "market_tickers": market_tickers
        }
    }
    await websocket.send(json.dumps(subscription))
​
Processing Messages
Handle incoming messages based on their type:
async def process_message(message):
    """Process incoming WebSocket messages"""
    data = json.loads(message)
    msg_type = data.get("type")

    if msg_type == "ticker":
        # Handle ticker update
        market = data["msg"]["market_ticker"]
        bid = data["msg"]["yes_bid_dollars"]
        ask = data["msg"]["yes_ask_dollars"]
        print(f"{market}: Yes Bid ${bid}, Yes Ask ${ask}")

    elif msg_type == "orderbook_snapshot":
        # Handle full orderbook state
        print(f"Orderbook snapshot for {data['msg']['market_ticker']}")

    elif msg_type == "orderbook_delta":
        # Handle orderbook changes
        print(f"Orderbook update for {data['msg']['market_ticker']}")
        # Note: client_order_id field is optional - present only when you caused this change
        if 'client_order_id' in data['msg']:
            print(f"  Your order {data['msg']['client_order_id']} caused this change")

    elif msg_type == "error":
        error_code = data.get("msg", {}).get("code")
        error_msg = data.get("msg", {}).get("msg")
        print(f"Error {error_code}: {error_msg}")
​
Connection Keep-Alive
The Python websockets library automatically handles WebSocket ping/pong frames to keep connections alive. No manual heartbeat handling is required. Learn more about automatic keepalive in the websockets documentation.
Other WebSocket libraries may require manual ping/pong implementation.
​
Subscribing to Channels
Once connected, subscribe to specific data channels:
​
Subscribe to Ticker Updates
To receive real-time ticker updates for all markets:
async def subscribe_to_tickers(self):
    """Subscribe to ticker updates for all markets"""
    subscription_message = {
        "id": self.message_id,
        "cmd": "subscribe",
        "params": {
            "channels": ["ticker"]
        }
    }
    await self.ws.send(json.dumps(subscription_message))
    self.message_id += 1
​
Subscribe to Specific Markets
To subscribe to orderbook or trade updates for specific markets:
async def subscribe_to_markets(self, channels, market_tickers):
    """Subscribe to specific channels and markets"""
    subscription_message = {
        "id": self.message_id,
        "cmd": "subscribe",
        "params": {
            "channels": channels,
            "market_tickers": market_tickers
        }
    }
    await self.ws.send(json.dumps(subscription_message))
    self.message_id += 1

# Example usage:
# Subscribe to orderbook updates
await subscribe_to_markets(["orderbook_delta"], ["KXFUT24-LSV", "KXHARRIS24-LSV"])

# Subscribe to trade feed
await subscribe_to_markets(["trade"], ["KXFUT24-LSV"])
​
Connection Lifecycle
Initial Connection: Establish WebSocket with authentication headers
Subscribe: Send subscription commands for desired channels
Receive Updates: Process incoming messages based on their type
Handle Disconnects: Implement reconnection logic with exponential backoff
​
Error Handling
The server sends error messages in this format:
{
  "id": 123,
  "type": "error",
  "msg": {
    "code": 2,
    "msg": "Params required"
  }
}
​
WebSocket Error Codes
Code	Error	Description	User error?
1	Unable to process message	The incoming message was not valid JSON, or a JSON field had a type incompatible with the websocket command schema.	Y
2	Params required	The command requires params or required subscription parameters are missing.	Y
3	Channels required	The subscribe command must include at least one channel.	Y
4	Subscription IDs required	The unsubscribe command must include at least one subscription ID in sids.	Y
5	Unknown command	The cmd value is not supported.	Y
6	Already subscribed	A subscription to the same channel is already active in this session.	Y
7	Unknown subscription ID	The command references a subscription ID that is not active in the session.	Y
8	Unknown channel name	The requested channel is not supported by this endpoint.	Y
9	Authentication required	The requested channel or action requires authentication or channel access that was not granted.	Y
10	Channel error	An internal channel error occurred while starting or running the subscription. If it persists, contact support@kalshi.com.	N
11	Invalid parameter	A parameter has an invalid format, such as a malformed market ID.	Y
12	Exactly one subscription ID is required	The update_subscription command must target exactly one subscription.	Y
13	Unsupported action	The subscription does not support the requested action.	Y
14	Market Ticker required	The command requires a market filter such as market_ticker or market_tickers.	Y
